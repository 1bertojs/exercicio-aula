    You
Why do they always send the poor?
Barbarisms by Barbaras
With pointed heels
Victorious Victorias kneel
For brand new spanking deals
Marching forward, hypocritic
And hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection
Yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ooh
Everybody's going to the party
Have a real good time
Dancin' in the desert
Blowin' up the sunshine
Kneeling roses disappearing
Into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox
Stealing our intentions
Hangers sitting, dripped in oil
Crying, "freedom"
Handed to obsoletion
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ooh
Everybody's going to the party
Have a real good time
Dancin' in the desert
Blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party
Have a real good time
Dancin' in the desert
Blowin' up the sunshine
Blast off, it's party time
And we don't live in a fascist nation
Blast off, it's party time
And where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Kneeling roses disappearing
Into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox
Stealing our intentions
Hangers sitting dripped in oil
Crying, "freedom"
Handed to obsoletion
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ooh
Everybody's going to the party
Have a real good time
Dancin' in the desert
Blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party
Have a real good time
Dancin' in the desert
Blowin' up the sun
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
They always send the poor
They always send the poor
